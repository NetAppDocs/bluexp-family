NetApp BlueXP is an evolution of Cloud Manager. BlueXP is a unified control plane that provides a hybrid multicloud experience for storage and data services across on-premises and cloud environments.

== Unified management experience

BlueXP enables you to manage all of your storage and data assets from a single interface. 

You can use BlueXP to create and administer cloud storage (for example, Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Azure NetApp Files), to move, protect, and analyze data, and to control many on-prem and edge storage devices.

== New navigation menu

In BlueXP's navigation menu, services are now organized by categories and are named according to their functionality. For example, you can access BlueXP backup and recovery (Cloud Backup) from the *Protection* category.

== New product integrations

* You can now manage the Amazon S3 buckets in the AWS accounts where the Connector is installed.
* You can now manage more on-prem storage systems, such as E-Series and StorageGRID. 
* You can now use data services previously only available as a standalone service with a separate UI, such as BlueXP digital advisor (Active IQ).
