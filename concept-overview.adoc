Cloud Manager is now called BlueXP. BlueXP enables you to build, protect, and govern your hybrid multicloud data from a single control plane.

== Unified management experience

BlueXP enables you to manage all of your storage and data assets from a single interface. 

You can use BlueXP to create and administer cloud storage (for example, Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Azure NetApp Files), use data services (for example, Cloud Backup and Cloud Data Sense), and control many on-prem and edge storage devices.

== New navigation menu

In BlueXP's navigation menu, data services are now organized by categories and are named according to their functionality. For example, you can access Cloud Backup by going to the *Protection* category and selecting *Backup and recovery*.
