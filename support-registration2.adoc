Before you can open a support case with NetApp technical support, you need to add a NetApp Support Site (NSS) account to Cloud Manager and then register for support.

== Support registration overview

There are two forms of registration to activate support entitlement:

*	Registering your Cloud Manager account ID support subscription (your 20 digit 960xxxxxxxxx serial number located on the Support Resources page in Cloud Manager).
+
This serves as your single support subscription ID for any service within Cloud Manager. Each Cloud Manager account-level support subscription must be registered.

*	Registering the Cloud Volumes ONTAP serial numbers associated with a subscription in your cloud provider's marketplace (these are 20 digit 909201xxxxxxxx serial numbers).
+
These serial numbers are commonly referred to as _PAYGO serial numbers_ and get generated by Cloud Manager at the time of Cloud Volumes ONTAP deployment.

Registering both types of serial numbers enables capabilities like opening support tickets, automatic case generation, and Active IQ.

How you register depends on whether you're an existing or new customer or partner.

* Existing customer or partner
+
As an existing NetApp customer or partner, you can conveniently use your NetApp Support Site SSO account to perform these registrations above. In the Support Dashboard, Cloud Manager provides an *NSS Management* page where you can add your NSS account. Once you add your NSS account, Cloud Manager automatically registers these serial numbers for you.

* New to NetApp
+
If you're brand new to NetApp, you must complete a one-time registration of your Cloud Manager account ID serial number on NetApp's support registration site. Once you complete this registration and create a new NSS account, you can use this account in Cloud Manager to auto register going forward.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the Cloud Manager console, click the Help icon, and select *Support*.

. Click *NSS Management > Add NSS Account*.

. When you're prompted, click *Continue* to be redirected to a Microsoft login page.
+
NetApp uses Microsoft Azure Active Directory as the identity provider for authentication services specific to support and licensing.

. At the login page, provide your NetApp Support Site registered email address and password to perform the authentication process.
+
These actions enable Cloud Manager to use your NSS account for things like license downloads, software upgrade verification, and future support registrations.
+
Note the following:
+
*	The account must be a customer-level account (not a guest or temp account).

*	Upon successful login, NetApp will store the NSS user name. This is a system generated ID that maps to your email. On the *NSS Management* page, you can display your email from the image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/cloud-manager-family/main/media/icon-nss-menu.png[An icon of three horizontal dots] menu.

*	If you ever need to refresh your login credential tokens, there is also an *Update Credentials* option in the image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/cloud-manager-family/main/media/icon-nss-menu.png[An icon of three horizontal dots] menu. Using this option prompts you to log in again.

== Register with NetApp as a new customer for support

If you're an existing NetApp customer with existing licenses and serial numbers and no NSS account, you can jump to step 9 below.

If you are brand new to NetApp and have no NSS account, follow each step below.

.	In the *Product Line* field, select *Cloud Manager* and then select your applicable billing provider.

.	Copy your Cloud Manager account serial number from step 2 above, complete the security check, and then confirm that you read NetApp's Global Data Privacy Policy.
+
An email is immediately sent to the mailbox provided to finalize this secure transaction. Be sure to check your spam folders if the validation email doesn't arrive in few minutes.

.	Confirm the action from within the email.
+
Confirming submits your request to NetApp and recommends that you create a NetApp Support Site account.

.	To create a NetApp Support Site account, complete the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/user/registration[NetApp Support Site User Registration form^]

.. Be sure to select the appropriate User Level, which is typically *NetApp Customer/End User*.

NetApp should reach out to you during this process. This is a one-time onboarding exercise for new users.

Once you have your NetApp Support Site account, you can navigate to Cloud Manager to add this NSS account for future registrations. The steps above can sometimes take upwards of 2 hours to complete.
