Before you can open a support case with NetApp technical support, you need to add a NetApp Support Site (NSS) account to BlueXP and then register for support.

== Support for cloud provider solutions
For technical support on the following cloud provider solutions you've integrated into BlueXP, refer to “Getting help” in the BlueXP documentation for that product.

== Support registration overview

There are two forms of registration to activate support entitlement:

* Registering your BlueXP account ID support subscription (your 20 digit 960xxxxxxxxx serial number located on the Support Resources page in BlueXP).
+
This serves as your single support subscription ID for any service within BlueXP. Each BlueXP account-level support subscription must be registered.

* Registering the Cloud Volumes ONTAP serial numbers associated with a subscription in your cloud provider's marketplace (these are 20 digit 909201xxxxxxxx serial numbers).
+
These serial numbers are commonly referred to as _PAYGO serial numbers_ and get generated by BlueXP at the time of Cloud Volumes ONTAP deployment.

Registering both types of serial numbers enables capabilities like opening support tickets and automatic case generation.

How you register depends on whether you're a new or existing customer or partner.

* Existing customer or partner
+
As an existing NetApp customer or partner, you can use your NetApp Support Site (NSS) SSO account to perform these registrations above. In the Support Dashboard, BlueXP provides an *NSS Management* page where you can add your NSS account. Once you add your NSS account, BlueXP automatically registers these serial numbers for you.
+
<<Add an NSS account to BlueXP,Learn how to add your NSS account>>.

* New to NetApp
+
If you're brand new to NetApp, you must complete a one-time registration of your BlueXP account ID serial number on NetApp's support registration site. Once you complete this registration and create a new NSS account, you can use this account in BlueXP to auto register going forward.

== Add an NSS account to BlueXP

The Support Dashboard enables you to add and manage your NetApp Support Site accounts for use with BlueXP.

* If you have a customer-level account, you can add one or more NSS accounts.

* If you have a partner or reseller account, you can add one or more NSS accounts, but they can't be added alongside customer-level accounts.

.Steps
 
. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, click the Help icon, and select *Support*.
+

. Click *NSS Management > Add NSS Account*.

. When you're prompted, click *Continue* to be redirected to a Microsoft login page.
+
NetApp uses Microsoft Azure Active Directory as the identity provider for authentication services specific to support and licensing.

. At the login page, provide your NetApp Support Site registered email address and password to perform the authentication process.
+
These actions enable BlueXP to use your NSS account for things like license downloads, software upgrade verification, and future support registrations.
+
Note the following:
+
* The NSS account must be a customer-level account (not a guest or temp account). You can have multiple customer-level NSS accounts.

* There can be only one NSS account if that account is a partner-level account. If you try to add customer-level NSS accounts and a partner-level account exists, you'll get the following error message:
+
"The NSS customer type is not allowed for this account as there are already NSS Users of different type."
+
The same is true if you have pre-existing customer-level NSS accounts and try to add a partner-level account.

* Upon successful login, NetApp will store the NSS user name. 
+
This is a system-generated ID that maps to your email. On the *NSS Management* page, you can display your email from the image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/cloud-manager-family/main/media/icon-nss-menu.png[An icon of three horizontal dots] menu.

* If you ever need to refresh your login credential tokens, there is also an *Update Credentials* option in the image:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetAppDocs/cloud-manager-family/main/media/icon-nss-menu.png[An icon of three horizontal dots] menu. 
+
Using this option prompts you to log in again. Note that the token for these accounts expire after 90 days. A notification will be posted to alert you of this.
